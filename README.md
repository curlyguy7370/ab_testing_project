A/B testing analysis on e-commerce KPIs with Python, Excel &amp; Tableau — real B2B marketing project.


## A/B Testing on Marketing Performance KPIs

This repository showcases an A/B testing project I conducted during an internship at a B2B digital-marketing company that supports retailers in optimizing their online performance.

The goal of the analysis was to evaluate key performance indicators, such as Conversion Rate.

The workflow included:

- Data processing and statistical testing in Python using CSV datasets exported from the company’s marketing dashboards

- Visualization and business interpretation in Tableau, with interactive dashboards to communicate insights

- Interpretation and reporting, highlighting statistically significant differences between control and test groups and providing actionable recommendations for the company’s clients.

This project demonstrates my ability to combine data analytics, statistical reasoning, and visualization to support data-driven marketing decisions in a real-world business context.
